DESCRIPTION
===========

The Flux content service is an append-only, immutable, content addressed
data storage service unique to each Flux instance, described in RFC 10.
All functions described below are idempotent.

``flux_content_load()`` sends a request to the content service
to load a data blob by *blobref*, a hash digest whose format
is described in RFC 10. A ``flux_future_t`` object which encapsulates the
remote procedure call state is returned. *flags* is a mask that may
include the values described below.

``flux_request_load_get()`` completes a load operation, blocking on
response(s) if needed, parsing the result, and returning the requested
blob in *buf* and its length in *len*. *buf* is valid until
``flux_future_destroy()`` is called.

``flux_content_store()`` sends a request to the content service
to store a data blob *buf* of length *len*. A ``flux_future_t``
object which encapsulates the remote procedure call state is returned.
*flags* is a mask that may include the values described below.

``flux_content_store_get()`` completes a store operation, blocking on
response(s) if needed, and returning a blobref that can be used to
retrieve the stored blob. The blobref string is valid until
``flux_future_destroy()`` is called.

These functions may be used asynchronously.
See ``flux_future_then(3)`` for details.


FLAGS
=====

The following are valid bits in a *flags* mask passed as an argument
to ``flux_content_load()`` or ``flux_content_store()``.

CONTENT_FLAG_CACHE_BYPASS
   Send the request directly to the backing store (default sqlite),
   bypassing the cache.

CONTENT_FLAG_UPSTREAM
   Direct the request to the next broker upstream on the TBON rather
   than to the local broker.


RETURN VALUE
============

``flux_content_load()`` and ``flux_content_store()`` return a
``flux_future_t`` on success, or NULL on failure with errno set appropriately.

``flux_content_load_get()`` and ``flux_content_store_get()``
return 0 on success, or -1 on failure with errno set appropriately.


ERRORS
======

EINVAL
   One of the arguments was invalid.

ENOMEM
   Out of memory.

ENOENT
   An unknown blob was requested.

EPROTO
   A request was malformed.

EFBIG
   A blob larger than the configured maximum blob size
   could not be stored. See flux-broker-attributes(7).

ENOSYS
   The CONTENT_FLAG_CACHE_BYPASS flag was set in a request, but no
   backing store module is loaded.

EHOSTUNREACH
   The CONTENT_FLAG_UPSTREAM flag was set in a request received by
   the rank 0 broker.
