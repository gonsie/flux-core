DESCRIPTION
===========

``flux_msg_handler_create()`` registers *callback* to be invoked when
a message meeting *match* criteria, as described in ``flux_msg_cmp(3)``,
is received on Flux broker handle *h*.

The message handler must be started with ``flux_msg_handler_start()`` in
order to receive messages. Conversely, ``flux_msg_handler_stop()`` causes
the message handler to stop receiving messages. Starting and stopping
are idempotent operations.

The handle *h* is monitored for FLUX_POLLIN events on the flux_reactor_t
associated with the handle as described in ``flux_set_reactor(3)``.
This internal "handle watcher" is started when the first message handler
is started, and stopped when the last message handler is stopped.

Messages arriving on *h* are internally read and dispatched to matching
message handlers. If multiple handlers match the message, the following
rules apply:

FLUX_MSGTYPE_REQUEST
   Requests are first delivered to a message handler whose match.topic_glob
   is set to an exact string match of the message topic glob. The most recently
   registered of these takes precedence. If an exact match is unavailable,
   the message is delivered to the most recently registered message handler
   for which ``flux_msg_cmp()`` returns true. If there is no match, an ENOSYS
   response is automatically generated by the dispatcher.

FLUX_MSGTYPE_RESPONSE
   Responses are first delivered to a matching RPC response handler
   (match.matchtag != FLUX_MATCHTAG_NONE). If an RPC response handler
   does not match, responses are delivered to the most recently registered
   message handler for which ``flux_msg_cmp()`` returns true. If there is no
   match, the response is discarded.

FLUX_MSGTYPE_EVENT
   Events are delivered to *all* matching message handlers.

``flux_msg_handler_destroy()`` destroys a handler, after internally
stopping it.


CAVEATS
=======

FLUX_MSGTYPE_EVENT messages are received on the handle only as
requested by ``flux_event_subscribe(3)``.

``flux-broker(1)`` only routes FLUX_MSGTYPE_REQUEST messages to comms
modules according to their registered service name, which is the same as
the module name. Other handle instances such as those on the local connector
cannot yet receive requests.


RETURN VALUE
============

``flux_msg_handler_create()`` returns a flux_msg_handler_t object on success.
On error, NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
======

ENOMEM
   Out of memory.
