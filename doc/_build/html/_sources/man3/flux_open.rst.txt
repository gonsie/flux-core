============
flux_open(3)
============


SYNOPSIS
========

#include <flux/core.h>

flux_t \*flux_open (const char \*uri, int flags);

void flux_close (flux_t \*h);

flux_t \*flux_clone (flux_t \*orig);


DESCRIPTION
===========

``flux_open()`` creates a ``flux_t`` handle, used to communicate with the
Flux message broker.

The *uri* scheme (before "://") specifies the "connector"
that will be used to establish the connection. The *uri* path
(after "://") is parsed by the connector. If *uri* is NULL,
the value of $FLUX_URI is used, if set.

*flags* is the logical "or" of zero or more of the following flags:

FLUX_O_TRACE
   Dumps message trace to stderr.

FLUX_O_MATCHDEBUG
   Prints diagnostic to stderr when matchtags are leaked, for example when
   a streaming RPC is destroyed without receiving a error response as
   end-of-stream, or a regular RPC is destroyed without being fulfilled at all.

FLUX_O_NONBLOCK
   The ``flux_send()`` and ``flux_recv()`` functions should never block.

``flux_clone()`` creates another reference to a ``flux_t`` handle that is
identical to the original in all respects except that it does not inherit
a copy of the original handle's "aux" hash, or its reactor and message
dispatcher references. By creating a clone, and calling ``flux_set_reactor()``
on it, one can create message handlers on the cloned handle that run on a
different reactor than the one associated with the original handle.

``flux_close()`` destroys a ``flux_t`` handle, closing its connection with
the Flux message broker.


RETURN VALUE
============

``flux_open()`` and ``flux_clone()`` return a ``flux_t`` handle on success.
On error, NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
======

EINVAL
   *uri* was NULL and $FLUX_URI was not set, or other arguments were invalid.

ENOMEM
   Out of memory.


EXAMPLES
========

This example opens the Flux broker using the default connector
and path, requests the broker rank, and finally closes the broker handle.
