flux-logger(1)

SYNOPSIS
========

**flux** **logger** [*--severity SEVERITY*] [*--appname NAME*] *message* *...*

DESCRIPTION
===========

flux-logger(1) appends Flux log entries to the local Flux
broker's circular buffer.

Log entries are associated with a syslog(3) style severity.
Valid severity names are *emerg*, *alert*, *crit*, *err*,
*warning*, *notice*, *info*, *debug*.

Log entries may also have a user-defined application name.
This is different than the syslog *facility*, which is always set
to LOG_USER in Flux log messages.

The wall clock time (UTC) and the broker rank are added to the log
message when it is created.

   Specify the log message severity. The default severity is *info*.

**-n, --appname**\ =\ *NAME*
   Specify a user-defined application name to associate with the log message.
   The default appname is *logger*.
