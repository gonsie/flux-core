.. flux-help-description: Invoke Flux comms message broker daemon

==============
flux-broker(1)
==============


SYNOPSIS
========

**flux-broker** [*OPTIONS*] [*initial-program* [*args...*]]

DESCRIPTION
===========

flux-broker(1) is a distributed message broker daemon that provides
communications services within a Flux comms session. It may be
launched as a parallel program under Flux or other resource managers
that support PMI.

Resource manager services are implemented as dynamically loadable
plugins to flux-broker(1), termed "comms modules".

flux-broker(1) instances within a comms session are interconnected using
ZeroMQ sockets, and each is assigned a rank from 0 to size - 1.
The rank 0 node is the root of a tree-based overlay network.
In addition, there is a multicast pub/sub network for events, and
a ring network for debugging. These networks may be accessed by
Flux commands and comms modules using Flux API services.

A periodic heartbeat event generated by rank 0 is used to synchronize
resource manager activities across the session.

A logging service aggregates Flux log messages across the session and
emits them to a configured destination on rank 0.

After its overlay networks have completed wire-up, flux-broker(1)
starts the initial program on rank 0. If none is specified on
the broker command line, an interactive shell is launched.


OPTIONS
=======

**-h, --help**
   Summarize available options.

**-v, --verbose**
   Be annoyingly chatty.

**-S, --setattr**\ =\ *ATTR=VAL*
   Set initial value for broker attribute.

**-k, --k-ary**\ =\ *N*
   Set the branching factor of this comms session's tree based overlay
   network (default: 2).

**-H, --heartrate**\ =\ *N.N*
   Set the session heartrate in seconds. The valid range is 0.01 to 30.0
   (default: 2.0).

**-X, --module-path**\ =\ *PATH*
   Override the compiled-in module search path (colon-separated).
   The default is to search install paths.

**-s, --security**\ =\ *MODE*
   Set the security mode. The mode may be *none*, *plain*, or *curve*
   (default: curve). See flux-keygen(1) for more information.

**-g, --shutdown-grace**\ =\ *SECS*
   Specify the shutdown grace period, in seconds (default: guess based
   on session size).
